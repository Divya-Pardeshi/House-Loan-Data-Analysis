# House-Loan-Data-Analysis --- Simplilearn
     
This repository contains the code and documentation for a deep learning model aimed at predicting loan default probabilities using historical loan data.
## Objective
The project focuses on leveraging historical loan data to build a robust deep learning model for predicting loan default probabilities, essential for secure lending practices.

## Key Steps
- **Data Loading and Overview:** Loading and examining the dataset, identifying null values, and analyzing the target variable.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling null values, encoding categorical columns, and balancing the dataset.
- **Model Development:** Constructing a deep learning model architecture using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Refinement:** Fine-tuning the model using stratified K-fold cross-validation and error analysis.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics, including ROC-AUC.

## Files
- `House_Loan_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation steps.
- `loan_data.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.
